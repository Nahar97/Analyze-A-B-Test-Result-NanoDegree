Project-3 Analyze A/B Test Result

Project Details
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project various Data Sets are used -
1. ab_data.csv
2. countries.csv

Overview of Project
A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

Summary
This is an A/B testing assignment completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Objectives
practice working on A/B testing projects and their practical difficulties. Perform A/B tests and make recommendations backed by computed inferences.
